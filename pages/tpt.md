### Test corrections quiz 1

#8
Correct answer: A-  By storing information about each call, the company can use machine learning and data mining and thereby make business decisions based on their customers’ needs.

#9
Correct answer: B- Correct. The company is not able to provide a human representative for calls made after business hours.

#10
Correct answer: A- -Correct. All information from the calling session (including personally identifiable information) is saved in a database. This information could be compromised if an unauthorized individual gains access to the database.

#11
Correct answer: D- There are trade-offs involved in choosing a compression technique for storing and transmitting data.

#7
Correct answer: C- The code segment initially sets start to 1, end to 20, and current to 3. Next, the code segment sets start to the value of current, which is 3. Then current is increased from 3 to 4. The final values of start and current are 3 and 4, respectively.

#14
Correct answer: C- The programs each display ten values, but each value displayed by program B is one greater than the corresponding value from program A. Program A displays 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and program B displays  2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11.

#21
Correct answer: B- This Boolean expression evaluates to true when counter (the number of temperatures greater than or equal to 90) is greater than 50% of total (the number of entries in the list).

#22
Correct answer: B- This option is correct. This code segment moves the robot forward two squares, rotates it right three times so that the robot faces the top of the grid, and then moves the robot forward three squares to the gray square.

#29
Correct answer: A- This option is correct. With these inputs, the AND gate will produce an output of false and the first OR gate will produce an output of false. Since both inputs to the second OR gate will be false, the circuit will have an output of false.

#30
Correct answer: D- Each call to the Analysis procedure requires one hour of program execution time. The procedure is called
once before the loop, and then four times inside the loop (once for each of the four entries in One word, genre List). Therefore, the program will take approximately 5 hours to execute.

#33
Correct answer: A- The flowchart sets include to true whenever floor is greater than 1 0 or bedrooms equal 3, and sets include to false otherwise. Therefore, the algorithm is equivalent to     Include, left arrow, open parenthesis, floor greater than 10, close parenthesis, OR, open parenthesis, bedrooms equal 3, close parenthesis.

#65
Correct answer: B- If y is negative, then the condition count equals y will never be met since count begins at 0 and repeatedly increases.

#66
Correct answer: C- he procedure returns the first number it encounters that is less than the first number in the list. For the list open bracket, 30, 40, 20, 10, close bracket, the procedure returns 2 0, which is not the least value in the list.
